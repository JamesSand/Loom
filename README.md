<p align="center"><em>You drive Claude Code / Codex — Loom keeps the worktrees, plans, diffs, and notes tidy.</em></p>

**Loom** is a lightweight task console for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
(and Codex). You give each task a goal, a deep‑interview pane refines it into a
`PLAN.md`, you spin up git worktrees on `zhongzhu/<slug>` branches and `/goal`
your way through the work, review the diff, and optionally get pinged whenever
the agent stops and needs you.

There is no autonomous agent loop, no worker, and no evaluator — **you drive the
agent**; Loom just removes the bookkeeping: worktrees, `PLAN.md`, diffs,
sessions, project notes, and notifications.

## The Loom flow

```
General goal ─▶ Start Deep Interview ─▶ Run /goal ─▶ Write result ─▶ (repeat)
                      │                     │              │
                 writes PLAN.md       executes PLAN.md   appends results
```

These three steps are the **Loom flow** buttons in the Claude tab. You start the
agent, let the deep interview turn your goal into `PLAN.md`, run `/goal` against
it, and write progress/results back into `PLAN.md` — then iterate.

```

```

(`.RUD/` is Loom's per-project task directory.)

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FutureMLS-Lab/Loom.git
cd Loom
pip install -e .

# Authenticate the agent CLI used by the pane (Claude Code shown here).
claude
```

Optional but needed for the live agent pane:

```bash
tmux -V       # tmux must be on PATH
git --version
```

This installs the `loom` command (the legacy `claudeloop` command remains as an
alias). The Python module is importable as `claudeloop`.

## Run

From any directory:

```bash
loom web --project /path/to/your/project --port 8765
# open http://127.0.0.1:8765/
```

Useful flags:

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--project PATH` | Project root. Defaults to `$PWD`. Can be a git repo OR a container directory holding several git repos. |
| `--skills PATH` | Default skills markdown injected into every agent session. Defaults to `claudeloop/skills/charlie_skills.md`. The per-task Skills picker only lists markdown under the skills directory. |
| `--projects` | Multi-project workspace: the launch dir is a container; the parent registry entry is pruned once children are registered. |
| `--auth-token TOKEN` | Require HTTP basic / bearer auth. Username is ignored; password = token. Also reads `CLAUDELOOP_WEB_AUTH_TOKEN`. |
| `--daemon` / `--nohup` | Re-spawn in the background and exit. Logs land in `<project>/.RUD/web.log`. |
| `--openclaw …` | Optional [OpenClaw](#openclaw-integration) gateway events (run-monitor notifications + reply-back). Full flag list in `claudeloop/cli.py`. |

```bash
loom init    # writes a minimal PLAN.md + NOTES.md in $PWD
loom --help  # all commands
```

## Web UI

### 1. Register a project

Use **+ Add repo** in the top bar. Registrations are stored in
`~/.claudeloop/web-projects.json` (no files are written outside the registered
path). If the launch directory is a container, pick from the subfolder chips.

### 2. Create a task

**Create Task** asks for:

- **Task type** — Claude, Codex, or Kernel Lab (a dropdown).
- **Title** — becomes the slug (lowercased, dash-separated).
- **General goal** — a short description the deep interview turns into `PLAN.md`.

A `.RUD/<slug>/` directory is created with an empty `PLAN.md`. If the project
root is itself a git repo, **one worktree is auto-created** at
`.RUD/<slug>/work/<repo-name>/` on branch `zhongzhu/<slug>`. Container projects
(no `.git` of their own) skip auto-creation — you pick the source repo from the
Claude tab. The default model is `claude-opus-4-8` for Claude tasks.

Click the title or goal in the task header to rename / re-goal at any time.

### 3. The Claude (or Codex) tab

The main tab for an agent task contains:

- **Loom flow row** — `Start Deep Interview → Run /goal → Write result`, with
  Start / Stop Claude above it.
- **Info card** with:
  - **Agent** — Claude or Codex (switch while stopped).
  - **Skills** — which skills markdown to inject (only files under the skills
    directory are listed).
  - **Worktrees** — every git worktree owned by the task, with branch, live
    `git status` (clean / N modified / ↑3 ↓2), a per-row **Push**, **+ Add
    worktree** (candidate picker; already-added ones dimmed), **Push all**, and
    a `×` to remove (`git worktree remove`).
  - **tmux** — the live pane target + alive/down pill.
  - **Sessions** — every agent session UUID the pane has spawned (scanned from
    `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/` or the Codex equivalent). **Resume**
    launches a fresh tmux pane with `--resume <uuid>`, even if the original
    tmux was killed.
  - **Monitor** — a Notify toggle (see [OpenClaw integration](#openclaw-integration)).
- **Live tmux pane** preview (polls every ~4s, auto-scrolls to the bottom) with
  a keycap row (↑ ↓ ← → Enter Esc Ctrl-C) next to the input.
- **Embedded read-only Markdown viewer** — defaults to `PLAN.md`, with a picker
  for any other top-level `*.md` in the task directory.

Starting the pane runs `tmux new-session` + the agent CLI in the **primary**
worktree (first in the worktrees list). **Start Deep Interview** then pastes a
prompt (general goal + selected skills) that interviews you and writes `PLAN.md`.

### 4. The Changes tab

A read-only, VSCode-style git diff for the task's worktree(s): a file list (with
add/remove counts and A/M/D/R status) on the left and a red/green unified diff on
the right. It shows both **uncommitted** changes (working tree vs `HEAD`,
including untracked files) and **committed** work (vs the detected base branch,
e.g. `origin/main`). Refreshes on tab open and via the Refresh button.

### 5. Run monitor + OpenClaw

Flip **Notify** on the Monitor row to have Loom watch the agent's tmux pane. It
edge-triggers on the **running → stopped** transition: when the agent was
working (the pane shows its “esc to interrupt” hint) and then stops to wait for
input, Loom emits an OpenClaw event with the last lines of the pane for context.
Reply in OpenClaw and it is pushed back into the pane
(`POST /api/tasks/<slug>/claude/send`), the agent runs again, and you're pinged
on the next stop — repeat. If the pane is already idle when you enable Notify,
it stays silent until the agent actually runs and then stops.

See [OpenClaw integration](#openclaw-integration) for setup.

### 6. PLAN.md & Notes

- The embedded viewer is read-only; the agent writes `PLAN.md` during the
  interview and you edit/`/goal` it inside the pane.
- The **📓 Notes** button opens a fullscreen editor for
  `<project>/.RUD/NOTES.md` — one project-scoped scratchpad. **Cmd/Ctrl + S**
  saves.

### 7. Kernel Lab (optional)

Kernel-optimization tasks get a dedicated panel that drives the TKCC kernel
evaluator: a persistent interview to produce a kernel spec, worktree management,
and a build/run launcher with a live log. This is an advanced, optional task
type; regular Claude/Codex tasks don't need it.

## OpenClaw integration

Loom can push events to an OpenClaw gateway. The headline use is the **run
monitor**: you get pinged (e.g. in Slack) whenever an agent stops and is waiting
for input, and your reply is sent straight back into its pane.

### Enable it

Launch Loom with the OpenClaw flags. Use the **`/hooks/agent`** endpoint with
`--openclaw-deliver` so messages are actually delivered — the lighter
`/hooks/wake` endpoint only *wakes* an agent and does not post a message:

```bash
loom web --project /path/to/project \
  --openclaw \
  --openclaw-url http://127.0.0.1:18789/hooks/agent \
  --openclaw-deliver \
  --openclaw-token <gateway-token> \
  --openclaw-debug            # logs each POST + HTTP status
```

Add `--openclaw-channel <#channel>` or `--openclaw-to <user>` if your gateway
needs an explicit destination. (Full flag list: `claudeloop/cli.py`.)

### What Loom sends

Loom emits lifecycle events — `task-created`, `claude-start` / `claude-stop`,
`worktree-created`, … — and, when a task's **Monitor** toggle is on, an
`agent-stopped` event each time that agent finishes a turn / waits for input,
carrying the last lines of the pane for context. The stop is detected by
watching the agent's "working" hint (`esc to interrupt`) and firing when it
disappears, so it does not depend on any particular "done" wording.

### Replying back into the pane

Your OpenClaw agent continues a task by calling Loom's inbound endpoint:

```
POST /api/tasks/<slug>/claude/send   {"text": "check the current pods", "submit": true}
```

It types the message into that task's live agent pane (auth header +
`?project=<id>` apply). The full loop is: **agent stops → OpenClaw pings you →
you reply → the reply lands in the pane → the agent continues → repeat.**

### Gateway on another host

If OpenClaw runs elsewhere, bridge the two with an SSH reverse tunnel from the
Loom machine, then point OpenClaw at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`:

```bash
ssh -f -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 -R 8765:127.0.0.1:8765 user@gateway-host
```

The bundled `claudeloop/skills/remote_control/` skill documents the full Loom
HTTP API for an OpenClaw agent (auth, project scoping, reading panes, sending
text, etc.).

## HTTP API

Everything is plain JSON; scope with `?project=<id>` (or the
`X-ClaudeLoop-Project` header). When `--auth-token` is set, send it as
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` (or HTTP basic, password = token).

Kernel Lab adds `/api/kernel/*` endpoints. For backwards compatibility,
`/api/tasks/<slug>/interview/{start,stop,paste-prompt}` still resolves to the
agent-pane endpoints.
