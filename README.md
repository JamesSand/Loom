<p align="center"><em>You drive Claude Code / Codex — Loom keeps the worktrees, plans, diffs, and notes tidy.</em></p>

**Loom** is a small web console for driving [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
(and Codex). You give a task a goal; Loom gives it a real terminal, turns the
goal into a `PLAN.md`, manages git worktrees, shows the diff, and pings you when
the agent needs input. There's no autonomous loop — **you drive the agent**;
Loom just keeps the bookkeeping tidy.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FutureMLS-Lab/Loom.git && cd Loom
pip install -e .

claude                                      # log in to the agent CLI once
loom web --project /path/to/your/project    # start the console
# → open http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

You also need **git** and **tmux** on your PATH. That's it — you're running.
(`loom` is the command; the old `claudeloop` name still works as an alias.)

## The basic flow

1. **+ Add folder** (top bar) — pick the repo you want to work in.
2. **Create Task** — give it a title and a one-line goal.
3. Open the task → **Start Claude**, and wait a few seconds for it to boot.
4. **Start Deep Interview** — answer its questions; it writes **`PLAN.md`**.
5. **Run /goal** — it works through the plan. Review in the **Changes** tab,
   click **Write result** to log progress back to `PLAN.md`, and repeat.

```
Create task ─▶ Start Claude ─▶ Deep Interview ─▶ Run /goal ─▶ Write result ─▶ (repeat)
```

When you're happy, **Push** the worktree or **Merge ↩** it from the Changes tab.

1. **Register your project.** Top bar → **+ Add folder**, pointed at a git repo
   (or a container directory holding several repos). Registrations live in
   `~/.claudeloop/web-projects.json`; nothing is written outside the path.

2. **Create a task.** **Create Task** asks for a **type** (Claude, Codex, Kernel
   Lab, or ARIS), a **title** (becomes the slug), and a **general goal**. Loom
   creates `.RUD/<slug>/` with an empty `PLAN.md`; if the project root is a git
   repo it auto-creates a worktree at `.RUD/<slug>/work/<repo>/` on branch
   `zhongzhu/<slug>`.

3. **Start the agent.** Task → **Claude** tab → **Start Claude** launches a tmux
   pane running the agent CLI in the task's `work/` worktree. The pane keeps
   running even if you close the browser.

4. **Run the deep interview.** **Start Deep Interview** pastes a prompt (your
   goal + selected skills); the agent interviews you and writes the agreed plan
   to `PLAN.md`. Answer in the terminal (real terminal: type, ↑/↓ to pick, Enter).

5. **Review the plan** in the embedded read-only viewer (defaults to `PLAN.md`).

6. **Execute it** with **Run /goal**; answer any prompts right in the terminal.

7. **Review the changes** in the **Changes** tab (uncommitted + committed diff);
   optionally **Review ⚖** for an AI review against your rules / skills.

8. **Write the result** with **Write result** to append progress to `PLAN.md`,
   then iterate (repeat 6–8).

9. **Ship it.** Loom never auto-commits — the agent commits in the worktree (or
   you do); then **Push** the worktree, or **Merge ↩** its branch back into the
   base branch from the Changes tab.

10. **(Optional) Notify.** Flip **Notify** on the Monitor row so Loom pings you
    (e.g. in Slack via OpenClaw) when the agent stops and waits for input; your
    reply is typed straight back into the pane.

11. **(Later) Resume.** Pick a past session from the **Sessions** dropdown →
    **Resume** to reopen it in a fresh tmux pane, even if the original was killed.

## Run options

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--project PATH` | Project root. Defaults to `$PWD`. A git repo OR a container directory holding several git repos. |
| `--skills PATH` | Default skills markdown injected into every agent session. Defaults to `claudeloop/skills/charlie_skills.md`. |
| `--projects` | Multi-project workspace: the launch dir is a container of repos. |
| `--auth-token TOKEN` | Require auth (HTTP basic / bearer; username ignored, password = token). Also reads `CLAUDELOOP_WEB_AUTH_TOKEN`. |
| `--daemon` / `--nohup` | Run in the background. Logs land in `<project>/.RUD/web.log`. |
| `--openclaw …` | Optional [OpenClaw](#openclaw-integration) notifications + reply-back (full flags in `claudeloop/cli.py`). |

(`.RUD/` is Loom's per-project task directory. The agent pane opens in `work/`.)

## Web UI reference

An agent task has two main tabs — **Claude** (or **Codex**) and **Changes** — plus
a read-only Markdown viewer (Kernel Lab tasks get their own panel). Every control:

| Where | Control | What it does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Claude tab** | **Start / Stop Claude** | Launch / kill the tmux pane (agent CLI in the primary `work/` worktree). Stopping keeps sessions resumable. |
| | **Loom flow** | Three buttons — **Start Deep Interview** → **Run /goal** → **Write result** (each pastes a prompt; run any, anytime). |
| | **Terminal** | Real xterm.js on the live PTY: type, arrows, Enter, Esc, Ctrl-C, paste all go to the agent; mouse-wheel scrolls history. |
| | **中文 / compose box** | Type Chinese (input-method-safe) or long text → **Enter** sends it into the pane. |
| | **Copy / paste** | Copy: select + **Cmd/Ctrl+C** (or Ctrl+Shift+C). Paste: **Cmd/Ctrl+V** (or Ctrl+Shift+V). |
| | **Agent** | Switch Claude ⇄ Codex (while stopped). New Claude tasks default to `claude-opus-4-8`. |
| | **Skills** | Which skills markdown to inject (files under the skills dir). |
| | **Worktrees** | Dropdown of the task's worktrees + live `git status`; **Push** (selected), **×** remove, **+ Add worktree**, **Push all**. |
| | **tmux** | The live pane target + an alive/down pill. |
| | **Sessions** | Dropdown of past agent sessions (newest first) + **Resume** — reopens it in a fresh pane, even if the tmux was killed. |
| | **Monitor** | **Notify** toggle → pings you (OpenClaw/Slack) when the agent stops; your reply is typed back into the pane. |
| | **Markdown viewer** | Read-only preview of `PLAN.md` (or any top-level `*.md`). The agent writes PLAN.md; you `/goal` it in the pane. |
| **Changes tab** | **Diff** | Read-only VSCode-style diff: uncommitted (vs `HEAD`, incl. untracked) + committed (vs base, e.g. `origin/main`). |
| | **Merge ↩** | Merge the worktree's branch into the base — `git merge --no-ff`; refuses if dirty, aborts on conflicts, never pushes. |
| | **Review ⚖** | AI review (`claude -p`) of the diff vs your rules (toolbar box) or the task's skills. |
| **Top bar** | **+ Add folder** | Register a repo from the Loom launch directory. |
| | **📓 Notes** | Fullscreen editor for `<project>/.RUD/NOTES.md` (one per project). **Cmd/Ctrl+S** saves. |

**Run monitor (Notify):** edge-triggers on *running → stopped* — when the agent was
working (pane shows "esc to interrupt") then stops for input, Loom sends an OpenClaw
event with the tail of the pane; your reply is typed back in and you're pinged again
on the next stop. (Enabled while the pane is idle, it stays quiet until the agent
next runs and stops.)

### Task types

| Type | What it is |
|------|------------|
| **Claude / Codex** | The standard human-driven flow above. |
| **ARIS** | Autonomous-research loop — mines ideas from the codebase, spins up a worktree per experiment, folds results into `PLAN.md` (skill: `claudeloop/skills/aris/ARIS.md`). |
| **Kernel Lab** | Dedicated panel driving the TKCC kernel evaluator (spec interview + build/run launcher with live log). Advanced / optional. |

## OpenClaw integration

Loom can push events to an OpenClaw gateway. The headline
use is the **run monitor**: you get pinged (e.g. in Slack) whenever an agent
stops and is waiting for input, and your reply is sent straight back into its
pane.

### Enable it

Launch Loom pointing at the **`/hooks/agent`** endpoint — message **delivery is
on by default**. (The lighter `/hooks/wake` endpoint only *wakes* the gateway
and does **not** post a message, so use `/hooks/agent`.)

```bash
loom web --project /path/to/project \
  --openclaw \
  --openclaw-url http://127.0.0.1:18789/hooks/agent \
  --openclaw-token <gateway-token> \
  --openclaw-debug            # logs each POST + HTTP status
```

Add `--openclaw-channel <#channel>` or `--openclaw-to <user>` if your gateway
needs an explicit destination. (Full flag list: `claudeloop/cli.py`.)

### What Loom sends

Loom emits lifecycle events — `task-created`, `claude-start` / `claude-stop`,
`worktree-created`, … — and, when a task's **Monitor** toggle is on, an
`agent-stopped` event each time that agent finishes a turn / waits for input,
carrying the last lines of the pane for context. The stop is detected by
watching the agent's "working" hint (`esc to interrupt`) and firing when it
disappears, so it does not depend on any particular "done" wording.

### Replying back into the pane

Your OpenClaw agent continues a task by calling Loom's inbound endpoint:

```
POST /api/tasks/<slug>/claude/send   {"text": "check the current pods", "submit": true}
```

It types the message into that task's live agent pane (auth header +
`?project=<id>` apply). The full loop is: **agent stops → OpenClaw pings you →
you reply → the reply lands in the pane → the agent continues → repeat.**

### Gateway on another host

If OpenClaw runs elsewhere, bridge the two with an SSH reverse tunnel from the
Loom machine, then point OpenClaw at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`:

```bash
ssh -f -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 -R 8765:127.0.0.1:8765 user@gateway-host
```

The bundled `claudeloop/skills/remote_control/` skill documents the full Loom
HTTP API for an OpenClaw agent (auth, project scoping, reading panes, sending
text, etc.).

## HTTP API

Everything is plain JSON; scope with `?project=<id>` (or the
`X-ClaudeLoop-Project` header). When `--auth-token` is set, send it as
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` (or HTTP basic, password = token).

agent-pane endpoints.
